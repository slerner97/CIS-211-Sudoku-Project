Sudoku Tile objects hold both a current
value and constraints on possible values.
Each tile may belong to more than one group

of other tiles in any of its groups.

# Design notes:
#    We want different kinds of tile events to guide
# view components in what to display (without putting
# those view design decisions here). I have chosen to
# create different TileEvent subclasses to indicate
# the event types.
#
# An alternative would be to pass a data value to indicate
# the event type. We could define symbolic constants
# to reduce the chance of hard-to-debug typographical errors,
# and we could use a Python Enum class to define those
# symbolic constants.  Enums do not act like other classes in
# Python, so I am reluctant to introduce them in this project.
#
# Using subclasses as I have here is almost like defining an
# Enum.  An advantage is that we could, if we needed to,
# add additional fields in a subclass for a particular event
# type.  A disadvantage is that we need to use the isinstance()
# method (usually in the view component) to determine which
# event type it is.
